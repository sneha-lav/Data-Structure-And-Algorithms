## 📌 Introduction
Welcome to my 100 Days of Code – Data Structures & Algorithms repository.
This repo exists because I decided that doing DSA daily is better than pretending it will magically make sense one day.

Over the next 100 days, this repository tracks my journey of learning, implementing, breaking, and finally understanding Data Structures and Algorithms—one problem at a time. The goal is not to be perfect, but to be consistent, show up daily, and slowly make peace with arrays, recursion, and other life challenges.

This repository reflects real learning: confusion, retries, small wins, and occasional “ohhh that’s how it works” moments.

## 🎯 Objectives of This Repository
- To build strong DSA fundamentals (without losing sanity)

- To improve problem-solving and logical thinking

- To stay consistent instead of cramming before exams

- To prepare for interviews and competitive programming

- To prove that daily effort actually compounds

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Day-wise DSA practice

- Core data structures and algorithms

- Clean but beginner-friendly implementations

- Logical approaches (and lessons learned from mistakes)

The difficulty increases gradually as concepts start making more sense (or at least feel less scary).

## 🗓️ Project Timeline
- [ ] Day 1 – 10  : Basics (confidence era)  
- [ ] Day 11 – 20 : Arrays & Strings (reality check)  
- [ ] Day 21 – 30 : Recursion (trust the function)  
- [ ] Day 31 – 40 : Linked Lists (pointer panic)  
- [ ] Day 41 – 50 : Stacks & Queues (LIFO life)  
- [ ] Day 51 – 60 : Trees (family issues)  
- [ ] Day 61 – 70 : Graphs (trust issues)  
- [ ] Day 71 – 80 : Greedy Algorithms (sometimes selfish works)  
- [ ] Day 81 – 90 : Dynamic Programming (reuse mistakes efficiently)  
- [ ] Day 91 – 100: Revision (everything finally clicks)  

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized day-wise or topic-wise to maintain clarity and consistency.
Each folder represents a specific day or concept and contains the corresponding code implementations and practice problems.

## 🚀 A Small Disclaimer

This repository is about learning in public.
Some solutions may not be the most optimized on day one—but they represent genuine progress, and that’s the point.

## 🌱 Final Thought

If DSA ever made you question your life choices, welcome — you’re among friends.

Happy coding 💻✨
