## 📚 Index – 100 Days of Code (DSA)
Welcome to my 100 Days of Code – Data Structures & Algorithms journey.
This repository exists because I decided that daily DSA practice is better than last-minute panic (jury’s still out, but we’re trying).

This index is your guide through the chaos, coffee, bugs, and breakthroughs that happened over 100 days of consistent coding.

## 🧭 The Roadmap (a.k.a. what I signed up for)
| Day Range | What I Thought It Was | What It Actually Is |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Day 1 – 10 | Easy start 😌 | Arrays judging me silently |
| Day 11 – 20 | Strings & sorting | Off-by-one errors |
| Day 21 – 30 | Recursion (fun!) | Recursion (why??) |
| Day 31 – 40 | Linked Lists | NULL pointer trauma |
| Day 41 – 50 | Stacks & Queues | Balanced, unlike me |
| Day 51 – 60 | Trees | Family problems (binary) |
| Day 61 – 70 | Graphs | Trust issues everywhere |
| Day 71 – 80 | Greedy algorithms | Sometimes selfish works |
| Day 81 – 90 | Dynamic Programming | Reusing mistakes efficiently |
| Day 91 – 100 | Revision | “Ohhh THAT’S why” moments |

## 🧠 Topics You’ll Find Here

- Arrays (where it all began)

- Strings (looks simple, isn’t)

- Searching & Sorting

- Recursion (again… and again…)

- Linked Lists

- Stacks & Queues

- Trees & Graphs

- Dynamic Programming (final boss)

- Each topic contains implementations, practice problems, and the occasional “why did this work?” realization.

## 🛠️ How to Use This Repo

- Start from Day 1 if you’re brave

- Jump to a topic if you’re revising

- Read code → run it → break it → fix it

- Repeat until concepts start making sense

## 🧘 Philosophy Behind This Repo

- Consistency > motivation

- Confusion is part of the process

- Bugs are just lessons with bad timing

- Progress ≠ perfection

## 🚀 Final Note

If you’re learning DSA and feel stuck — congrats, you’re doing it right.

Happy coding ✨
